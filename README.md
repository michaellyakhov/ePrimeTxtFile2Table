# ePrimeTxtFile2Table
Converts E-prime text files to a matlab table for easy access and viewability. Implicaations: If not licensed in E-prime 3 but still want to access data for underpriveleged labs or low-ranking analyzers who don't yet have permissions, helps with creating a script (see my other repository on that) to automate fMRI data analysis with SPM>

An efficient function I developed to read ePrime.txt files and convert them to a matlab table for easy viewing. For me, the issue of reading .txt files surfaced when I was creating a script to automate data analysis for an fMRI Schizophrenia study. My computer wasn't licensed to E-Prime 3, and I didn't have permissions to download the demo file. But I noticed the lab outputed .txt files in addition to the e-Prime spreadsheet, so I made a function that formats the .txt file into a matlab table to continue on with my script (which can be found under my other repository).

Enjoy! You may have to change the directories, I would recommend setting them as an input to the function for maximum efficiency.
